# Hood Watch
### **By MosesOpiyo**

## Description
This is a project that allows residents in a neighbourhood to have eyes and ears so to speak of everything occurence around the neighbourhood.
The project is a two part project consisting of a frontend and backend made in angular and django respectively.

## Link to Frontend
For front end referencing, use the link below:

https://github.com/MosesOpiyo/hood_watch_frontend

## Local Setup

# Angular
1. Create a directory to house the entire application and from here on I will refer to it as dir1 for reference purposes.
2. While inside dir1 run the following code git clone https://github.com/MosesOpiyo/hood_watch_frontend.git
3. Then navigate to that file TUZO and run npm install to install all the requirements.
4. Finally run ng serve -o to run the local server.

# Django
1. Navigate to dir1 and create another empty directory to house the backed bit.
2. Inside this directory run git clone https://github.com/MosesOpiyo/hood_watch.git and navigate into the directory TUZO
3. Create a virtual environment inside this repository python3 -m venv --without-pip virtual and activate it using source virtual/bin/activate.
4. Run pip instal -r requirements.txt
5. Finally run python3 manage.py runserver
